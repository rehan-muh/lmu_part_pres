#### This paper was presented at the 5th Munich-UCLA Historical Linguistics Colloquium

### This github page is to share the references, presentation, data, and the scripts for the analyses.
### If anything seems confusing or you find errors (!), please reach out to me at rehanmuh@g.ucla.edu
### Because of a lack of computational resources, I wasn't able to run the MCMC algorithm for the iterations recommended for published studies or to get an ESS for some of the branch lengths, so the results should be re-evaulated by running the scripts again (if one so wishes).
